Hebrac's Dungeon - 2015 7DRL Challenge

Somewhat playable version. If you found some bugs, please email me (thjalfa@libero.it). Original idea: http://www.pagat.com/invented/hebrac.html

(In a Unix-like enviroment:)
to compile, just write "gcc hebrac2015.c" in the terminal, inside the folder where hebrac2015.c is. 
To run, write "./a.out". If you want a fancier output name, compile with "gcc hebrac2015.c -o yourname" and run
with "./yourname". Tested only on a MacOSX.
